# Nodejs App with Passport Authentication using PostGresql 

This app is just an implementation of passport with postgresql.

I decided to use PG because most of the online resources about Nodejs 
are using MongoDB which i personally hate.

This is like a starter app if you want to make an app using something 
else other than MongoDB.
